For mark 2:

Create a player and a Casino task.

A Casino takes random (float) time to open, after that prints “Casino: opened” and it checks for a player to enter. It can terminate (select with terminate) if nobody comes, it checks infinitely many times, if somebody came. If a player comes prints “Casino: a player got in” and prints “Casino: finished” when finished.

A player takes also random (float) time to arrive, it prints "player: arrived", then calls the Casino to play, tries to enter immediately (call with select of immediate meeting type), he tries 3 max times. If successful, he writes "player: got in" and finishes, and it does not try again. If not successful, tries max 3 times, if after 3 trials did not go in, prints “player: failed to enter”.

The main program prints "Game started".

Possible printings:

Game started

player: arrived

player: try again

player: try again

player: try again

player: failed to enter

player: finished

Casino: opened

OR

Game started

Casino: opened

player: arrived

Casino: a player got in

Casino: finished

player: got in

player: finished

 

For mark 3. (it is different from mark 2!!).

Convert the player task into a task type, with player name as a discriminant (the number of player transformed to String). Each player has a random Boolean to decide if he is going in or not (in both rounds) and tries to go in within 1 second (use the corresponding select).

If he goes in to Casino, he scores points (random value that he generates between 0 and 1000). He writes "player_name, he got points: " and the points value, and then he goes home.

If he couldn't go in, he tries once again after 1 second.

If never got in, he writes "player_name did not play" and goes home.

Create an array of 10 players in main, each created at 0.5 second intervals (the array index is the name of the player),

The Casino will allow a player to get in within 1 second, for up to 5 players, and will keep open for 15 seconds from the start (use Clock) after which closes. Print all activities, with the name of the players too.
