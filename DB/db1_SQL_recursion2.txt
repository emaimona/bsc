Another recursion in SQL  (START WITH, CONNECT BY)
--------------------------------------------------

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
START WITH condition
CONNECT BY condition

This is a special SQL query type by which we can query tree structures (graphs).
We identify the root of the tree with START WITH condition.
We identify the parent-child relationship with CONNECT BY condition.
In CONNECT BY we have to use the PRIOR keyword to distinguish the column of a parent and a child node (row).

START WITH -> finds root node (or root nodes)
CONNECT BY -> relationship between parent and child rows (we should use PRIOR for parent rows)

Steps of evaluation in recursive queries:
-----------------------------------------

1. START WITH selects root nodes (rows)

2. CONNECT BY finds children of roots

3. Finds ancestors with a depth first strategy

4. WHERE filters rows. If condition is TRUE, record remains in result set.

5. Returns rows in preorder traversal.

If a SELECT uses CONNECT BY, take care with JOINS.


We can use several conditions after CONNECT BY. eg.
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr AND sal > comm
empno -> parent node or record (see PRIOR), other columns -> child node (record)

PRIOR is a unary operator
-------------------------
We must use PRIOR in CONNECT BY clause at least once, otherwise we cannot express the
parent-child relationship.

LEVEL pszeudo column
--------------------
It returns 1 for root nodes, 2 for their children, etc.

Example:
--------
SELECT   LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename, empno, mgr, job, LEVEL
FROM nikovits.emp
START WITH   job='PRESIDENT'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR empno = mgr;

Ordering siblings:
ORDER BY  -> SIBLINGS [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] 

Example:
--------
SELECT   LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename, empno, mgr, job, LEVEL
FROM nikovits.emp
START WITH   job='PRESIDENT'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename;  --  [NULLS FIRST | LAST]

We can use aggregation and grouping in these queries.

Example:
--------
Give the sum money of the grandchildren of KAIN.

SELECT   SUM(money) -- LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || name, parent, money
FROM nikovits.parentof
WHERE LEVEL = 3
START WITH  name='KAIN'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent;

A new table: ParentOf(name, parent, money, city)
------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE ParentOf(name, parent, money, city)
AS SELECT nev, decode(apja, 'NINCS', 'NO', apja), vagyon, varos FROM nikovits.vagyonok;
-- grant select on parentof to public;

Compare the following queries and notice the role of PRIOR operator.

-- ABEL's all descendants
SELECT  LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || name, parent, money
FROM nikovits.parentof
WHERE name like '%%'     -- we could omit WHERE clause
START WITH  name='ABEL'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent;

-- ABEL's descendants whose all ancestors have a letter 'A' in his name
SELECT  LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || name, parent, money
FROM nikovits.parentof
WHERE name like '%%'
START WITH  name='ABEL'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent and prior name like '%A%';

-- ABEL's descendants who and whose all ancestors have a letter 'A' in his name
-- No PRIOR in second condition of CONNECT BY
SELECT  LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || name, parent, money
FROM nikovits.parentof
WHERE name like '%%'
START WITH  name='ABEL'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent and name like '%A%';


CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator
------------------------
At any level we can refer to a column of the root node with this operator.

Example:
--------
Give the names whose city is the same as ADAM's city.

SELECT  LPAD(' ', 2*(LEVEL-1)) || name, parent, city, CONNECT_BY_ROOT city
FROM nikovits.parentof
WHERE city = CONNECT_BY_ROOT city
START WITH  name='ADAM'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent;


SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH function: SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(column, char)
----------------------------------------------------------------
SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH concatenates the given column of the nodes from root to actual node.
Second parameter is the delimeter character (or string).

Example:
--------
SELECT  name, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(name,'.'), SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(city,'.')
FROM nikovits.parentof
START WITH  name='ADAM'
CONNECT BY  PRIOR name = parent;


If the graph has a cycle we have to use NOCYCLE keyword.


Our earlier example about flights
---------------------------------
CREATE TABLE Flight(airline, orig, dest, cost)
AS SELECT legitarsasag, honnan, hova, koltseg from nikovits.jaratok;
GRANT select on flight to public;


-- or CREATE an empty table then insert rows:
CREATE TABLE Flight(airline VARCHAR2(10), orig VARCHAR2(15), dest VARCHAR2(15), cost NUMBER);

INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'San Francisco', 'Denver', 1000);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'San Francisco', 'Dallas', 10000);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Denver', 'Dallas', 500);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Denver', 'Chicago', 2000);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Dallas', 'Chicago', 600);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Dallas', 'New York', 2000);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Chicago', 'New York', 3000);
INSERT INTO flight VALUES('Lufthansa', 'Chicago', 'Denver', 2000);

-- There is a cycle in the graph of Flight table. 
-- If we delete the last row, there will be no cycle in the graph.

delete from flight where orig='Chicago' and dest='Denver';

Example:
--------
Which cities can be reached from San Francisco?

SELECT LPAD(' ', 4*level) ||orig, dest, level-1 turnovers
FROM flight
START WITH orig = 'San Francisco'
CONNECT BY PRIOR dest = orig;

The previous SELECT doesn't work if there is a cycle in the graph.
Use the following instead (-> NOCYCLE):

SELECT LPAD(' ', 4*level) ||orig, dest, level-1 turnovers
FROM flight
START WITH orig = 'San Francisco'
CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR dest = orig;


Other pszeudo columns:

CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE: returns 1 if actual row has a child that is an ancestor of it too.
CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF:  returns 1 if actual row has no child. (or has only child that was an ancestor)

Example:
--------
List the routes from San Francisco.

SELECT CONNECT_BY_ROOT orig AS first, dest AS final_dest, LEVEL, 
       SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(orig, '->')||'->'||dest "route",        -- we concatenate the final dest at the end
       CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE, CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF
FROM flight                                                       
START WITH orig='San Francisco'
CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR dest = orig
ORDER BY LEVEL;



Let's see our earlier query based on a Datalog query
----------------------------------------------------
Reaches(X,Y)  <--  Flight(X,Y)
Reaches(X,Y)  <--  Flight(X,Z) AND Reaches(Z,Y) AND X <> Y

SQL query
---------

WITH  reaches(orig, dest) AS 
 (
  SELECT orig, dest FROM flight
   UNION ALL
  SELECT flight.orig, reaches.dest FROM flight, reaches
  WHERE flight.dest = reaches.orig AND flight.orig <> reaches.dest
  )
  CYCLE orig SET is_cycle TO 'Y' DEFAULT 'N' 
SELECT  distinct orig, dest FROM reaches order by orig, dest;


Create the Reaches table from Flight table with a CONNECT BY query
------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT distinct CONNECT_BY_ROOT orig AS orig, dest AS dest
FROM flight
WHERE CONNECT_BY_ROOT orig <> dest
START WITH 1=1                         -- we start recursion from each node
CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR dest = orig
ORDER BY orig, dest;

With recursive statement 'WITH' we can compute (produce) new values, but with
'CONNECT BY' we can get only existing values from our table.
The query below couldn't be produced by a 'CONNECT BY' recursive query, e.g.

Produce a relation Factorial(n, val) where val = n!
---------------------------------------------------
Factor(X, Y) <-- X=1 AND Y=0
Factor(X, Y) <-- Factor(Z, V) AND X=Z+1 AND Y=X*V AND X < 40    
(--> X < 40: not to produce an infinite relation, see "safety" of a DATALOG rule)


WITH  factorial(n, val) AS 
 (
  SELECT 0, 1 FROM dual
   UNION ALL
  SELECT n+1, (n+1)*val FROM factorial
  WHERE n < 40                          
  )
  CYCLE n SET is_cycle TO 'Y' DEFAULT 'N'   -- we can omit this line, there is no cycle
SELECT  n, val FROM factorial order by 1;
