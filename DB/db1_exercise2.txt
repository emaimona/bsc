Compulsory exercise for practice 2
===========================================================================================
Create a table in both databases (ullman, aramis) whose name is PRACTICE2, and it contains 
the name of those who like both apple and pear (see LIKES table below).

In the following you can check on your own whether you completed the compulsory exercises
with the following SQL query:

SELECT object_name "TABLE", created FROM user_objects 
WHERE object_type='TABLE' AND object_name LIKE 'PRACTICE%'
ORDER BY object_name;
*******************************************************************************************

LIKES (name, fruits)
----------------------

NAME     FRUITS
---------------
Piglet   apple
Piglet   pear
Piglet   raspberry
Winnie   apple
Winnie   pear
Kanga    apple
Tiger    apple
Tiger    pear

-- DROP TABLE likes; (drop the table if it exists already)

-- Create your own empty table.
CREATE TABLE LIKES (NAME varchar(14), FRUITS varchar(14));

-- Insert rows into the table.

   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','pear');
   insert into LIKES values ('Piglet','raspberry');
   insert into LIKES values ('Winnie','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Winnie','pear');
   insert into LIKES values ('Kanga','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Tiger','apple');
   insert into LIKES values ('Tiger','pear');

commit;  -- see later, but don't forget, it is important
-- grant select on LIKES to public;

SELECT * FROM likes;  -- query your own table

-- Query the table of the instructor: 
SELECT * FROM nikovits.likes;

-- Create your own table from an existing one: (don't forget to drop the old one if exists)
CREATE TABLE likes AS SELECT * FROM nikovits.likes;
