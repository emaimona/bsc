Compulsory exercise for practice 11
===========================================================================================
Create a table in both databases (ullman, aramis) with 2 columns whose name is PRACTICE11 and it 
contains the name (Ename) and salary (Sal) of those employees who are subordinates of JONES
(whose manager is JONES, whose manager's manager is JONES etc.) and the hiredate of the subordinate
was later than the hiredate of JONES.

You can check whether you completed the compulsory exercises with the following SQL query:

SELECT object_name "TABLE", created FROM user_objects 
WHERE object_type='TABLE' AND object_name LIKE 'PRACTICE%'
ORDER BY object_name;

Recursion in SQL queries
------------------------

/* DATALOG-like
Take the relation FLIGHT and give a recursive query for the following:
Give all the possible routes from Orig city to Dest city with the total cost of the route.
  FLIGHT(airline VARCHAR2(10), orig VARCHAR2(15), dest VARCHAR2(15), cost NUMBER);
Help:
Use a temporal relation Reaches(x,y,c,r) which gives the pair of cities (x,y) for which
it is possible to get from city x to city y by taking one or more flights, and c is the total
cost of that flight, r is the route (concatenated string).
First specify the Datalog rules for Reaches(orig,dest,cost,route) then rewrite it into an SQL recursive query,
then write a procedure where p_orig and p_dest are parameters.
