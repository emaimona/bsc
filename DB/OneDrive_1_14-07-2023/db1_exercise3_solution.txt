SELECT round(sqrt(sal), 2), trunc(round(sqrt(sal), 2), 0)  FROM emp;

8. In which month was the hiredate of ADAMS? (give the name of the month)
9. Give the number of days since ADAMS's hiredate. 
SELECT hiredate, trunc(sysdate - hiredate), to_char(hiredate, 'Month')  
FROM emp WHERE ename = 'ADAMS';

10. List the employees whose hiredate was Tuesday. (Take care of the length of name_day string!)
-- alter session set nls_date_language='english';
SELECT ename, hiredate FROM emp WHERE to_char(hiredate, 'day') LIKE 'tuesday%';

11. Give the manager-employee name pairs where the length of the two names are equal.

FROM emp e1, emp e2 
WHERE e1.empno = e2.mgr and length(e1.ename) = length(e2.ename);

12. List the employees whose salary is in category 1. (see Sal_cat table)
SELECT ename, category FROM emp, sal_cat
WHERE sal BETWEEN lowest_sal AND highest_sal AND category=1;

13. List the employees whose salary category is an even number.
SELECT ename, category FROM emp, sal_cat
WHERE sal BETWEEN lowest_sal AND highest_sal AND mod(category,2)=0;

14. Give the number of days between the hiredate of KING and the hiredate of JONES.
SELECT k.hiredate - j.hiredate FROM emp k, emp j 
WHERE k.ename='KING' AND j.ename='JONES';

15. Give the name of the day (e.g. Monday) which was the last day of the month in which KING's hiredate was.
SELECT to_char(last_day(hiredate), 'day') FROM emp WHERE ename='KING';

16. Give the name of the day (e.g. Monday) which was the first day of the month in which KING's hiredate was.
SELECT to_char(trunc(hiredate, 'month'), 'day') FROM emp WHERE ename='KING';

SELECT ename, dname, category FROM emp e, dept d, sal_cat sc

AND dname LIKE '%C%' AND category >= 4;

18. List the name and salary of the employees, and a charater string where one '#' denotes 1000 (rounded)
(So if the salary is 1800 then print -> '##', because 1800 rounded to thousands is 2.)
-- Take care of rpad function. rpad('', 3, 'x') = rpad(null, 3, 'x')
SELECT ename, sal, rpad('#', round(sal, -3)/1000, '#') FROM emp;
