Recursion in SQL queries
------------------------

/* DATALOG-like
Take the relation FLIGHT and give a recursive query for the following:
Give all the possible routes from Orig city to Dest city with the total cost of the route.
  FLIGHT(airline VARCHAR2(10), orig VARCHAR2(15), dest VARCHAR2(15), cost NUMBER);
Help:
Use a temporal relation Reaches(x,y,c,r) which gives the pair of cities (x,y) for which
it is possible to get from city x to city y by taking one or more flights, and c is the total
cost of that flight, r is the route (concatenated string).
First specify the Datalog rules for Reaches(orig,dest,cost,route) then rewrite it into an SQL recursive query,
then write a procedure where p_orig and p_dest are parameters.
*/
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE route_costs(p_orig VARCHAR, p_dest VARCHAR) IS
Test: 
set serveroutput on
execute route_costs('San Francisco','New York'); 
-----------------------------------------------------
The Datalog rules for Reaches(orig,dest,cost,route) and the recursive WITH statement.

Reaches(X,Y,C,R)  <--  Flight(_,X,Y,C) AND R=X||Y
Reaches(X,Y,C,R)  <--  Reaches(X,Z,C1,R1) AND Flight(_,Z,Y,C2) AND C=C1+C2 AND R=R1||Y AND X <> Y

WITH  reaches(orig, dest, cost, route) AS 
 (
  SELECT orig, dest, cost, orig||dest FROM flight
   UNION ALL
  SELECT ...                                            -- here comes the recursive part 
  )

SELECT  distinct orig, dest, cost, route FROM reaches
